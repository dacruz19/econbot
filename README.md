# econbot

Just an economy bot, make sure to put your token in the auth.py file if your going to use it. The python script needs 2 extra files, `cooldown.json`
which just stores cooldown for daily reward and `data.json` which is probably the most important one since it stores users' ids as well as currency.
Make sure to make those two files for the script and bot to run properly. For the admin commands such as ``setC``, change the userid to your since 
otherwise it would be useless, anyways have fun.
